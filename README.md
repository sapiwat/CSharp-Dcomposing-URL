# C# URL Decomposer & Parser

A specialized **C# Console Utility** designed to parse and extract structured information from raw URL strings. This project demonstrates my ability to handle string parsing logic and understand the fundamental components of web addressing.

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes & Skills

Through this exercise, I have refined my technical skills in:

- **String Decomposition:** Identifying and extracting specific components such as **Scheme (Protocol), Host (Domain), Port, Path, and Query Parameters**.
- **URI Standards:** Gaining a deeper understanding of the **RFC 3986** standards for Uniform Resource Identifiers.
- **Logic for Web Routing:** Simulating how backend systems interpret incoming requests to direct users to the correct resource or data.
- **Data Extraction Patterns:** Using C# string methods (or the `Uri` class) to efficiently split and categorize web data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET 8
- **Application Type:** Console Utility / Logic Exercise

## 📝 Project Motivation

In a modern SaaS environment like **TechnologyOne**, understanding how data travels through URLs is essential for managing **Deep Linking, API Routing, and Session Management**. I built this tool to ensure I have a robust grasp of how web addresses are structured and how to programmatically manipulate them to retrieve essential metadata.
